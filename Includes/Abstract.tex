\noindent Software Developers exchange information all the time to improve skills and solve problems. Many of this informations are lost due to the use of medias that don't offer support to information storage, recovery and visualization.

This work presents a tool that allows developers to combine text, code and external references to artifacts and later its retrieving. It also presents studies during its development and evaluation. Even though improvements related to arctifacts preview be needed, it supports knowledge sharing between developers through the storage of solutions, information and references. It provides a startup point for future tools with the same purpose.

\noindent\textit{Keywords}: Software Documentation. Software Reuse. Software Development.
