\noindent It compares medias used by software developers to solve problems. Finds problems with these medias. Builds a tool where users can store text, code and external references into artifacts to improve the knowledge management by software development teams. Evaluates the tool with a group of developers. Concludes that even if it requires some improvements with the preview of the artifacts, the tool supports the knowledge sharing between developers through the storage of solutions and sharing of information and references to the team.

\noindent\textit{Keywords}: Knowledge Management, Software Reuse, Software Development.
